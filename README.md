This will be a blog about any topic related to machine learning, and possibly topics in communications and information theory if i feel like writing on those subjects at some future date. Mainly, I will be emphasizing machine learning topics as I learn them in graduate school for use in research. This will serve two purposes. First, it will allow me dissemenate ideas to a wider audience that is interested in programming. Secondly, it will provide me ample practice to refine my own understanding of the subject by writing about complex ideas in order to arrive at more truth. Ultimately, this is a blog about topics in pattern recogition. But any other topics may periodically or aperiodically enter into a blog post such as controls, communication, or something far flung.
