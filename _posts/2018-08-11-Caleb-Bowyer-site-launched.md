Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. My own descriptions of intricate machine learning concepts will be posted as I learn about them in graduate school. Posts will not be ordered based on difficulty of material but what i feel like sharing or what is racing through my mind any given day.
