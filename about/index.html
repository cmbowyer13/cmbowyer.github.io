Graduate Student at UF specialized in control theory research and beginning studies in machine learning, communications, and
information theory. I love absolutely all fields of engineering. I believe that passion stems from my bachelors degree in 
physics and astronomy. I worked on a wide array of research at Hampden-Sydney college. 
I built a solar thermal panel to passively cool a concrete structure, studied interferometry using lasers, and
performed different studies of binary star systems after taking an observational astronomy course.
